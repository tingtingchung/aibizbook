**Praises**  
"I really appreciate the business centered framing of this textbook. Clear positioning at the intersection of AI and business. Unlike most AI/ML texts that are heavily CS-oriented, this book anchors each topic in functional business domains and real-world cases."  

"I really appreciated the thoughtful presentation of foundational topics in a way that avoids overwhelming the reader. The chapter does a great job breaking down core math concepts such as dot products, gradients, and probability into digestible explanations supported by examples. The section on python is also well-executed and very relevant to students who will use these tools directly in their coursework."  

"I also appreciated the conversational tone and the use of relatable analogies (including baking, sports rankings) to introduce otherwise abstract ideas. These examples make the content much more approachable for business students without compromising the technical rigor."  

"I really enjoyed the general writing style of this chapter. The writing style is conversational, engaging, and far more accessible than many traditional AI texts. The authors do a good job avoiding jargon when possible and explaining key terms and operations clearly."  

"Visuals and practical analogies are particularly helpful in lowering the barrier to entry for students with limited technical confidence."  

"I like the writing style. I do like the periodic injection of fun facts on the side just to keep the material from feeling so heavy. Great examples once again."  

"I like how the authors convey and maintain their enthusiasm for the material throughout the chapter. This is exemplified by the noticeably frequent appearance of the exclamation point in their text, usually at the culmination of a teachable deduction/realization for the reader’s benefit. In general, the pattern goes like, “If you think about A and combine it with what you’ve already learned about B, you’ll discover that you now know how to do C as well!” This conversational tone is the difference between teaching the material and merely talking about the material. I find this both refreshing and critically important for reaching students with a business background.  

This is also apparent when they present material in a question-and-answer form. By asking and then answering questions that a reasonably attentive reader would have at a given moment as they work through the chapter, the authors reaffirm that they are mentors genuinely interested in helping the reader learn the material, not academics tossing out facts that the reader must collect and figure out on their own.  

Finally, the authors aren’t afraid to outright empathize with the student/reader. My favorite example is the chapter’s sidebar, which plainly acknowledges the existence of “scary-looking equations.” Once again, the authors address a huge elephant in the room: the equations themselves (even for the more mathematically inclined) are often quite intimidating to look at. By helping the reader pick apart patterns and meanings in the equations, whether step-by-step in the text or showing them examples pre-programmed in Excel or Google Sheets, it’s a lot easier to actually hear the music behind the notes written on the page."

"In my view, the authors have hit a nice sweet spot with these aspects of the book, especially in terms of size. If these sections were quite lengthy, much of it would run the risk of being ignored by students (unless specifically assigned by the instructor), while anything significantly less might be viewed as unimportant.  

Reading the chapter with a student mindset, I found myself wanting to spend a nominal amount of time with these sections after finishing the chapter for my own satisfaction and verification that I grasped the concepts presented. This is precisely the feeling of interest and curiosity that I would like my students to experience in any textbook, a feeling I again credit to the authors’ more conversational and mentoring tone they are setting in the book."  

"The use of analogies is excellent and aligns with how I often explain concepts in class. This style also avoids the density of traditional AI texts while still treating students as capable learners. Code examples are thoughtfully integrated and appropriately scoped. The inclusion of real business contexts is a major strength that reinforces relevance and application. My students consistently engage more when the use cases align with business problems they understand or aspire to work on."  

"I also think the text, as it is developing, is doing a good job of breaking down the material into very digestible pieces for students. This gives students more convenient starting and stopping points to engage with the material. To draw an analogy to reading a novel, I vastly prefer novels with many short chapters/sections to ones with much longer chapters. There’s something about dropping a bookmark at a stopping point created by the author that is very satisfying versus dropping it in the middle of a long section of text out of necessity because I need to stop reading for a while. These shorter, clearly delineated sections also help me set reading goals as I proceed."
