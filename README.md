Praises
"I really appreciated the thoughtful presentation of foundational topics in a way that avoids overwhelming the reader. The chapter does a great job breaking down core math concepts such as dot products, gradients, and probability into digestible explanations supported by examples. The section on python is also well-executed and very relevant to students who will use these tools directly in their coursework."  

"I also appreciated the conversational tone and the use of relatable analogies (including baking, sports rankings) to introduce otherwise abstract ideas. These examples make the content much more approachable for business students without compromising the technical rigor."  

"I really enjoyed the general writing style of this chapter. The writing style is conversational, engaging, and far more accessible than many traditional AI texts. The authors do a good job avoiding jargon when possible and explaining key terms and operations clearly."  

"Visuals and practical analogies are particularly helpful in lowering the barrier to entry for students with limited technical confidence."  

"I like the writing style. I do like the periodic injection of fun facts on the side just to keep the material from feeling so heavy. Great examples once again."  

"I like how the authors convey and maintain their enthusiasm for the material throughout the chapter. This is exemplified by the noticeably frequent appearance of the exclamation point in their text, usually at the culmination of a teachable deduction/realization for the reader’s benefit. In general, the pattern goes like, “If you think about A and combine it with what you’ve already learned about B, you’ll discover that you now know how to do C as well!” This conversational tone is the difference between teaching the material and merely talking about the material. I find this both refreshing and critically important for reaching students with a business background.  

This is also apparent when they present material in a question-and-answer form. By asking and then answering questions that a reasonably attentive reader would have at a given moment as they work through the chapter, the authors reaffirm that they are mentors genuinely interested in helping the reader learn the material, not academics tossing out facts that the reader must collect and figure out on their own.  

Finally, the authors aren’t afraid to outright empathize with the student/reader. My favorite example is the chapter’s sidebar, which plainly acknowledges the existence of “scary-looking equations.” Once again, the authors address a huge elephant in the room: the equations themselves (even for the more mathematically inclined) are often quite intimidating to look at. By helping the reader pick apart patterns and meanings in the equations, whether step-by-step in the text or showing them examples pre-programmed in Excel or Google Sheets, it’s a lot easier to actually hear the music behind the notes written on the page."
